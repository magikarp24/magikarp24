There is something so intrinsically beautiful about the human mind, and about art. Through our vessel, we give life to new inventions, new ideas, just as a god would. I am not to believe in god, as the notion of a god implies that something could exist that could make something so beautiful, or, equally, I feel the argument could be made, so ugly. Even if a god is to exist, it is a debate that should be had as to whether or not they should be worshipped.
</p>
<p>
Family is something that's never particularly been important to me. In fact, I have quite a distain for family. As the saying goes, the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. If a god exists, you should be able to denounce it, because, as proven by parenthood, those who create are not always deserving even to do so much as gaze at the beauty of their creation.
</p>
<p>
If there is one thing that the world has created, that has been so magnificant, that it is worth the stain that every other existing thing has imprinted on this world, it is that of the most beautiful minded person I have ever witnessed, and, I believe, will ever be witnessed. That of my dear [Redacted].
</p>
<p>
Earlier, I was questioning whether or not those who have created our existence should be worshipped. I need not dwell on that idea anymore, because I have found the answer. It is insulting to believe that we should worship the one who has created these beauties, as the true thing that should be worshipped is that of the beauty itself. You, my dear [Redacted], are who I worship. You are who I'm devoted to. The idea that I could so much as even entertain the thought that something else should be worshipped is something that I should live in shame with for the rest of my days.
</p>
<p>
How could someone as feeble minded and pathetic as me deserve to gaze upon your beauty? How could anyone, anything for that matter, have the faintest amount of worth as to be placed upon the same planet that you lie in. I don't believe there is anything that would be worthy, or valuable enough to be on the same planet as you. Perhaps we should rid ourselves of the filth on this earth, so that it will remain pure, as you are the only thing that could be considered as such.
</p>
<p>
It is quite strange an idea to propose the thought that I could be considered so much as a friend to you. I understand that I am not of your quality, and I'm so sorry that I cannot be as such. I wish I could give you everything you desire. I will make it my life's mission to come as close as I can to that. You, my dear, I wish I could take away all the things plauging your mind, all the things that cause you to abuse your body in the way you do. You deserve true happiness in the purest form, and I am close to tears thinking that this cruel, disgusting world, could rid you of that.
</p>
<p>
I love you with every molecule in my body. This statement will remain true for as long as I live. You are my everything, and I cannot express how lucky, how grateful I am to have you. You have enriched my life, you have blessed me, and, for as long as I live, I will forever be yours.
