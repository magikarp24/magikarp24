	It was many and many a year ago,<br>
   In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
   By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
   Than to love and be loved by me.<br><br>

I was a child and she was a child,<br>
   In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
   I and my Annabel Lee—<br>
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br>
   Coveted her and me.<br><br>

And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
   In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
   And bore her away from me,<br>
To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
   In this kingdom by the sea.<br><br>

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
   Went envying her and me—<br>
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
   In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br><br>

But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
   Of those who were older than we—<br>
   Of many far wiser than we—<br>
And neither the angels in Heaven above<br>
   Nor the demons down under the sea<br>
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br><br>

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
   In her sepulchre there by the sea—<br>
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.<br>
