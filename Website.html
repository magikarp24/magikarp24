					This is a collection of images, writings, and music, some of which made by me, and others not, that remind me of you. My typing style is quite obnoxious and pseudointellectual. Please don't think it's on purpose. It's just, everytime I try to express myself, it comes out that way.<br>
					Please take this as an expression of my love, albeit a pathetic attempt. I just wanted to do something for you, to show you how much you meant to me.<br>
